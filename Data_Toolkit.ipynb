        "- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for numerical computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It includes optimized mathematical functions for performing fast operations on arrays, such as linear algebra, statistical analysis, and random number generation. NumPy is widely used because it offers significant performance improvements over Python lists, supports vectorized operations, and serves as the foundation for many data science libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and TensorFlow."

When performing operations between arrays of incompatible shapes, NumPy automatically expands the smaller array along missing dimensions to match the larger array. This feature optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary data duplication and enables more efficient computations."

When slicing a NumPy array, it does not create a new array but instead provides a reference to the original data, making operations highly efficient. In contrast, Python lists store elements as separate objects in memory, and slicing creates a new list, increasing memory usage and processing time.\n",
